## Reflective Summary
In this class the focus was on using Agile to develop somthing with a group. Learning to use Agile was a interesting and eye opening expreience. The importance of comunication when building an app together is super crutial. I beleve that developing this App in Unity with a team of three was a very usefull experience for any job I might encounter in the future.
